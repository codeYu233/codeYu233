### Hi there 👋

I am an undergraduate student in Artificial Intelligence at UESTC, expected to graduate in 2026. My research interests focus on multimodal learning and large models, aiming to bridge AI and real-world applications. I believe multimodal approaches are key to endowing AI with genuine intelligence by enabling it to perceive and interact with the world in a human-like way. Through this work, I aspire to bring AI closer to reality and push the boundaries of its potential.
